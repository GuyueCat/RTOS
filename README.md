## FreeRTOSv202112.00
Upgrading From FreeRTOS V10.3.0 to V10.4.x
Note on future versioning:
Until now the FreeRTOS zip file releases have carried the version number of the kernel release they contain. For example, FreeRTOSv10.4.0.zip contains version 10.4.0 of the FreeRTOS kernel. However, the kernel is not the only individually versioned library contained in the zip file, and the number of libraries in the zip file will increase in future releases. Therefore, to better reflect that the zip file actually contains a collection of libraries integrated together, future releases will use a date stamp version instead of the kernelâ€™s version
